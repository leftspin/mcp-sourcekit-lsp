# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Introduction

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). As the documentation describes it: "Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications."

## Purpose

The protocol helps developers build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs by providing a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Key Features

1. **Pre-built Integrations**: Provides a growing list of pre-built integrations for LLMs
2. **Provider Flexibility**: Offers flexibility to switch between LLM providers
3. **Security Best Practices**: Implements best practices for securing data infrastructure

## Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture with several key components:

- **MCP Hosts**: Applications like Claude Desktop that want to access data
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients maintaining connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs exposing specific capabilities
- **Local Data Sources**: Computer files, databases, and services
- **Remote Services**: External systems accessible via APIs

## Core Concept

The protocol enables a host application to connect to multiple servers, allowing seamless integration of AI models with various data sources and tools. This creates a standardized "plug-and-play" ecosystem for AI application development.

## Support and Community

MCP is an open-source project with:
- Multiple SDK implementations (Python, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, C#, Swift)
- Active community discussions on GitHub
- Official documentation at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
