# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - it provides a universal, standardized way to connect AI models to various data sources and tools.

## Key Benefits

- **Standardized Integration**: Connect AI models to data and tools using a common protocol
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between different LLM providers
- **Security**: Built-in best practices for secure data handling
- **Modularity**: Build complex AI agents and workflows with pre-built integrations

## Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture with these key components:

1. **MCP Hosts**: Applications like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
2. **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain connections with servers
3. **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol
4. **Local Data Sources**: Computer files, databases, and local services
5. **Remote Services**: External systems accessible via APIs

## Core Concepts

### Resources
Resources are how servers expose data to LLMs. Think of these like GET endpoints - they're used to load information into the LLM's context.

### Tools
Tools provide functionality that LLMs can use. Similar to POST endpoints, they execute code or produce side effects.

### Prompts
Prompts are reusable templates for LLM interactions, allowing servers to define common interaction patterns.

## Available SDKs

Official SDKs are available for multiple languages:
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - The most mature SDK
- **Python** - Full-featured implementation
- **Kotlin** - Maintained in collaboration with JetBrains
- **Ruby** - Maintained in collaboration with Shopify
- **C#** - Maintained in collaboration with Microsoft

## Getting Started

To build an MCP server, you'll need to:

1. Choose an SDK for your preferred language
2. Create a server instance that implements the MCP protocol
3. Define your resources, tools, and prompts
4. Choose a transport mechanism (stdio for local, HTTP for remote)
5. Connect your server to MCP-compatible clients

## Example Use Cases

- **File System Access**: Let LLMs read and write files on your computer
- **Database Integration**: Query and modify databases directly from AI tools
- **API Connections**: Connect to external services like GitHub, Slack, or Google Drive
- **Development Tools**: Integrate with IDEs, debuggers, and build systems
- **Enterprise Systems**: Connect to internal tools and knowledge bases
